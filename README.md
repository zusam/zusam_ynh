*This package allow you to install Zusam quickly and simply on a YunoHost server.

## :warning: This is an alpha release. Things can go wrong. Use at your own risk.

This package is still in a very early stage and not well tested. Please make sure to have a personal backup ready in case of things go wrong (do not rely solely on the backup of Yunohost for now).  
Fortunately, Zusam is easy to backup and restore by hand. The only concerned directory is the `data` dir that is located under `/var/www/zusam` by default.
